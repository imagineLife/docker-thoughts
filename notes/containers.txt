What?!
HISTORY
- used to need a bunch of physical servers…
    - dell
    - emc
    - hardware
    - BENEFITS
        - security
        - custom fine-tuning
    - PROBLEMS
        - always need more than you need
        - capacity is limited
        - takes TIME to add servers
- VIRTUAL MACHINES
    - a layer of abstraction between us & the metal
    - multiple guest instances of linux running inside a HOST instance of  linux
    - BENEFIT
        - spin up a new vm
    - PROBLEMS
        - example
            - give 2 companies the same server,
            - competing for source machine resources
            - bugs can go cross vm
        - performance
            - 10 VMS in one physical server
                - means REDUNDANT stuff, like OSs
    - CAN….
        - limit resources

PUBLIC CLOUD
- get VMS from hosted services, AWS, GCP
    - BENEFITS
        - cheaper than humans
        - front-end engineers can manage servers!
    - PROBLEM
        - still have to manage…
            - software
            - networking
            - updating

CONTAINERS
- 3 Kernel Features put together
    - chroot
    - namespaces
    - control-groups (cgroups)

(the KERNEL connects the application software to the hardware of the machine)

NOTE: the bin folder has the binaries that we need
