KERNEL FEAT 2: NAMESPACES
this is about un-sharing process capabilities

problem with chroot alone.
chroot is concerned with isolating file-system 'roots'
BUT IF 2 chrooted envs are next to one-another, they can see each others processes

- list processes
ps

companyA process can KILL companyB processes

Introducing name-spaces to restrict capabilities

using UNSHARE command

RUN THESE COMMANDS, get a new env up && running
in the parent container
# updates available packages I can use
- apt-get update

# a tool
# https://wiki.debian.org/Debootstrap
- apt-get install debootstrap -y

debootstrap --variant=minbase bionic /better-root
...
- minbase tells to download least amt of stuff necessary
- bionic is kind of ubuntu
- /better-root is new root name
... gets the bare minimunm stuff (filesystem stuff) needed to run a debian-based ubuntu
... should end terminal output with 'Base system installed successfully'

SEE the new bin tools in this dir
ENTER these commands
cd better-root
chroot . bash
ls bin

...here will show many bin tools i can use in this debootstrapped env!
